# Lung_Cancer_Detection
Classification of images based on the tumor present in the lungs.
I segregated the images and labeled them as tumor or non tumor from CT Scan DICOM images. The labelling was done based on a CSV file provided with the central position of the tumor for every patient.
After carefully checking all the images, I segregated them and then classified them into tumorous and non tumours using CNN on top dense layers.
