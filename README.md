Classification of images based on the tumor present in the lungs.
I segregated the images and labeled them as tumor or non tumor from DICOM images. The labelling was done based on csv file obtained which mentioned in which slide for every patient was the center of the tumor. After carefully checking all the images, I segregated them and then classified them into tumorous and non tumours using CNN on top dense layers.
